Note: This assumes that both MongoDB v2.6.3 and Node.js v0.10.29 are installed on the computer the app is being run on.
It may function with earlier versions, but functionality may not be complete.

Navigate into the Server folder, and run the run.bat file. This will start the server and allow connection with MongoDB.
Once that is done, the app can be started by opening the login html file in the root of the zip file. Chrome is the 
reccomended browser.
